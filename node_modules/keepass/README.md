This library under active development. Do not use it in production, before 1.x.x released.

As a proof of concept for development of this library i am working on chrome
extension, electron app and cordova app (all will be under GPL-3).

Initially it was keepass.io fork, but eventually i rewrite almost everything and end by digging in keepass sources.
