I was looking for the beginning of a new statement.
If you just proceed without changing anything, I'll ignore
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

     curl1}..{curl1}
l.84     draw z0 --
                    z1; 
I need a `known' x value for this part of the path.
The value I found (see above) was no good;
so I'll try to keep going by using zero instead.
(Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook explains that
you might want to type `I ???' now.)
