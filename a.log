I was looking for the beginning of a new statement.
If you just proceed without changing anything, I'll ignore
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

                   :
l.5 beginfig(1):
                
I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.
(See Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.)

! Inconsistent equation (off by 6).

                   ;
l.11     y0 = 11.0uy;
                     
The equation I just read contradicts what was said before.
But don't worry; continue and I'll just ignore it.

                   ;
l.12     x1 = 13.0ux;
                     
The equation I just read contradicts what was said before.
But don't worry; continue and I'll just ignore it.

! Inconsistent equation (off by -13).
<to be read again> 
                   ;
l.13     y1 = 9.0uy;
                    
The equation I just read contradicts what was said before.
But don't worry; continue and I'll just ignore it.
